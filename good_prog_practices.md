### good programming practices

- understand requirements, objectives before starting to write any code
- comment, doc strings
- naming conventions
- functions, classes, modules - DRY, reuse, learn to google well
- don't reinvent the wheel, don't blindly copy/paste code
- separate data and logic
- use config, don't hardcode
- never store passwords, keys in your code
- logging with a proper logger
- error handling with exceptions etc.
- graceful failure != silent failure
- don't optimize, automate unnecessarily
- version control
- testing
- use proper debugger
- don't ignore warnings - e.g. deprecations, type conversions etc.
- have your code reviewed
- document and share learnings
- back up, check in to bitbucket frequently
- use TODO as a reminder of fixing small things
- ask for help when you're stuck
- learn to adapt - writing bad code when required is okay
